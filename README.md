# OWASP Software Component Verification Standard

The Software Component Verification Standard (SCVS) is a community-driven effort to establish a framework for 
identifying activities, controls, and best practices, which can help in identifying and reducing risk in a software 
supply chain.

Managing risk in the software supply chain is important to reduce the surface area of systems vulnerable to exploits,
and to measure technical debt as a barrier to remediation. 

Measuring and improving software supply chain assurance is crucial for success. Organizations with supply chain
visibility can protect their brand, increase trust, reduce time-to-market, and impact costs in the event of a
supply chain incident. 

Software supply chains involve:
 - technology
 - people
 - processes
 - institutions
 - and additional variables
 
It is important to acknowledge that raising the bar for supply chain assurance requires the active participation of
risk managers, mission owners, and business units like legal and procurement, which have not traditionally been involved
with technical implementation. 

Determination of risk acceptance criteria is not a problem that can be solved by enterprise tooling: it is up to risk
managers and business decision makers to evaluate the advantages and trade-offs of security measures based on system
exposure, regulatory requirements, and constrained financial and human resources. Mandates that are internally
unachievable, or that bring development or procurement to a standstill, constitute their own security and institutional
risks. 

SCVS is designed to be implemented incrementally, and to allow organizations to phase in controls at different levels 
over time.

### SCVS has the following goals:

* Develop a common taxonomy of activities, controls, and best-practices that can reduce risk in a software supply chain
* Devise a path to baseline and mature software supply chain vigilance
