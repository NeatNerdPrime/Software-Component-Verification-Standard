# Using the SCVS

SCVS has the following goals:

* Develop a common taxonomy of activities, controls, and best-practices that can reduce risk in a software supply chain
* Devise a path for baselining and maturing software supply chain vigilance

## Software Component Verification Levels

The Software Component Verification Standard defines three security verification levels, with each level increasing in depth.

* SCVS Level 1 is for low-assurance requirements where basic forms of analysis would suffice.
* SCVS Level 2 is for moderately sensitive software where additional analysis or due diligence is required.
* SCVS Level 3 is for high-assurance requirements due to the sensitivity of data or use of the software.
