# Using the SCVS

SCVS has the following goals:

* Develop a common taxonomy of activities, controls, and best-practices that can reduce risk in a software supply chain
* Devise a path to baseline and mature software supply chain vigilance

## Software Component Verification Levels

The Software Component Verification Standard defines three security verification levels, with each level increasing in depth.

* SCVS Level 1 is for low-assurance requirements where basic forms of analysis would suffice.
* SCVS Level 2 is for moderately sensitive software where additional analysis or due diligence is required.
* SCVS Level 3 is for high-assurance requirements due to the sensitivity of data or use of the software.

## How to use this standard

One of the best ways to use the Software Component Verification Standard is to use it as a method of assessment and a 
way to sequence incremental improvement. Tailoring the SCVS to your use cases will increase the focus on the security 
requirements that are most important to your organization.

One use case for the SCVS is to assess internal software development processes and capabilities. Another is to evaluate 
suppliers, which can include open source software maintainers, contract software developers, and commercial software 
vendors. 

### Assessing First Party Capabilities
SCVS provides a structured method to assess and qualify internal software capabilities and processes, and to identify 
areas where verifiability can be improved. Because of the tiered and topical structure of SCVS, the same organization 
can be at different levels within or across categories of verification. Depending on required levels of assurance for a 
given system, different levels of SCVS components may be required for system approval.

SCVS components are formulated to be automatable, and to provide the basis for system approval on a continuous basis. 
Given the rate of change in software composition, especially for capabilities developed in a continuous integration 
pipeline, continuity of assurance requires continuous vs. one-time verification. 

### Evaluating Suppliers
SCVS provides a standardized way to assess supply chain transparency provided by contract or outsourced software 
developers, based on the documentation and metadata present in the supplier's software development workflow and/or 
provided with software deliverables. Specifically, the provision of a software bill of materials (SBOM) can be 
requested or required by software customers to establish supply chain visibility and differentiate suppliers. 

Because of the tiered and topical structure of SCVS, it can be used for analysis of alternatives and/or used in whole 
or in part to evaluate proposals for procurement. SCVS components at different levels can be used to qualify 
eligibility for procurement, or as an element of numerical scoring of proposals. 

Supplier provision of software bills of materials and other verification data allows customers to monitor risks present 
in supplier software on an ongoing basis to achieve visibility regardless of supplier-provided notification or updates. 
The auditability of this data enables formulation and enforcement of contractual provisions to remediate known 
vulnerabilities within a specified time period.

## Applying SCVS

The Software Component Verification Standard places emphasis on controls which can be implemented or verified
through automation. The domains and their controls are not specific to a single development team. They represent
stakeholders across an organization, including software developers, security and risk managers, and procurement
departments. Active participation of all stakeholders is necessary to measure and improve cyber posture. 
Once an organization has baselined its current maturity, it can determine goals and timelines for improved maturity
and devise methods for which the controls can be implemented or verified through automation.

Attainment of higher-level controls may be more dependent on business process than available technical methods.
