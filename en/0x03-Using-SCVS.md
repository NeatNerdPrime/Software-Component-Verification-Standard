# Using the SCVS

SCVS has the following goals:

* Develop a common taxonomy of activities, controls, and best-practices that can reduce risk in a software supply chain
* Devise a path to baseline and mature software supply chain vigilance

## Software Component Verification Levels

The Software Component Verification Standard defines three security verification levels, with each level increasing in depth.

* SCVS Level 1 is for low-assurance requirements where basic forms of analysis would suffice.
* SCVS Level 2 is for moderately sensitive software where additional analysis or due diligence is required.
* SCVS Level 3 is for high-assurance requirements due to the sensitivity of data or use of the software.

## How to use this standard

One of the best ways to use the Software Component Verification Standard is to use it as a blueprint to create a
checklist specific to your business unit or organization. Tailoring the SCVS to your use cases will increase the focus
on the security requirements that are most important to your organization.

## Applying SCVS

The Software Component Verification Standard places emphasis on controls which can be implemented or verified
through automation. The domains and their controls are not specific to a single development team. They represent
stakeholders across an organization, including software developers, security and risk managers, and procurement
departments. Active participation of all stakeholders is necessary to measure and improve cyber posture. 
Once an organization has baselined its current maturity, it can determine goals and timelines for improved maturity
and devise methods for which the controls can be implemented or verified through automation.

Attainment of higher-level controls may be more dependent on business process than available technical methods.
