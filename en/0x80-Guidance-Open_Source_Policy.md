# Guidance: Open Source Policy

The following points should be viewed as suggestions based on the success and best practices of organizations 
employing them. They are not part of the SCVS taxonomy.

- All organizations that use open source software should have an open source policy
- The open source policy is supported and enforced by cross-functional stakeholders
- The open source policy should address:
  - The age of a component based on its release or published date
  - How many major or minor revisions old are tolerated
  - Guidance for keeping components continuously updated via automation
  - Avoidance on using components with known vulnerabilities
  - Mean-time-to-remediate criteria for updating at-risk components
  - Restrictions on using components that are end-of-life or end-of-support
  - Guidance for using fewer and better suppliers
  - Usage-based list of acceptable licenses
  - Dynamic list of unapproved or forbidden components
  - Require development teams provide all modifications back to the community producing the component
  - Prohibit modifications to open source components that are not in the best interest of the community producing the component
