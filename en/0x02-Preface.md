# Preface

Welcome to the Software Component Verification Standard (SCVS) version 1.0. The SCVS is a community-driven effort to establish a framework for identifying activities, controls, and best practices which can help in identifying and reducing risk in a software supply chain.

Software supply chains involve:
 - technology
 - people
 - processes
 - institutions
 - and additional variables
 
 
< todo: expand on why this is so important and include references to external resources - not industry specific >

brand damage, costs to mitigate compromised supply chains, impact to CIA, fines, regulatory and compliance, impact to environment (IoT/MedTech), cost of recall, 

Increase brand perception and loyalty, increased trust, cost savings, time-to-market (SOKP), reuse of common components and frameworks, increased agility, 


 All of this makes software supply chains difficult to secure. Identifying and reducing risk in the software supply chain requires agility and iterative execution from cross-functional teams.
