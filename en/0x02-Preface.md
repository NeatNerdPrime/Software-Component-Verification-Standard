# Preface

Welcome to the Software Component Verification Standard (SCVS) version 1.0. The SCVS is a community-driven effort to establish a framework for identifying activities, processes, and best practices which can help in identifying and reducing risk in a software supply chain.

Software supply chains involve technology, people, processes, environmental and geo-political factors, partnerships, and many other variables which make supply chains challenging to secure. Identifying and reducing risk in the software supply chain requires agility and iterative execution from cross-functional teams.
